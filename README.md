This is a simple sudoku solver I have created.

The point of this is to emulate my thought process when solving sudoku puzzles and to see if i could solve a puzzle.

It currently can solve upto hard sudoku puzzles on sudoku.com.

Currently the script is basic and takes in a csv file and loops through all the numbers to try and find positions where only one number can be.

I have yet to emulate my use of pen-notes to reduce the empty squares
